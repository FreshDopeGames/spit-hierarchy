# Developer Notes - Social Authentication Removal

## Overview
Social authentication has been temporarily removed from the application while preserving the complete infrastructure for future restoration.

## What Was Preserved
1. **Complete SocialAuthButtons component** - Commented out but fully functional
2. **Social authentication logic** - All handlers and state management preserved
3. **TypeScript interfaces** - All types maintained for future use
4. **UI structure** - Layout logic preserved for when social buttons return

## Code Markers Used
- `/* SOCIAL_AUTH_DISABLED ... SOCIAL_AUTH_DISABLED */` - Large code blocks
- `// SOCIAL_AUTH_RESTORATION_POINT:` - Individual lines to uncomment
- `// FUTURE_USE:` - Preserved types and interfaces

## Current State
- Only email/password authentication is active
- Social authentication code is preserved but disabled
- All social provider setup documentation is available
- Restoration process is documented step-by-step

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/auth/SocialAuthButtons.tsx` - Component disabled but preserved
2. `src/pages/Auth.tsx` - Social auth integration commented out
3. `docs/SOCIAL_AUTH_SETUP.md` - Complete provider setup guide
4. `docs/SOCIAL_AUTH_RESTORATION.md` - Step-by-step restoration guide

## Next Steps for Restoration
1. Follow the restoration guide in `docs/SOCIAL_AUTH_RESTORATION.md`
2. Configure OAuth providers using `docs/SOCIAL_AUTH_SETUP.md`
3. Uncomment preserved code sections
4. Test each provider thoroughly

## Benefits of This Approach
- Zero knowledge loss - all implementation details preserved
- Quick restoration when needed - just uncomment and configure
- Clean current codebase - no unused social auth code running
- Complete documentation - future developers have full context
- Type safety maintained - interfaces preserved for compilation

## Testing Current State
The application now only supports email/password authentication:
- Sign up with email/password works
- Sign in with email/password works  
- No social authentication options visible
- Clean, focused authentication UI
